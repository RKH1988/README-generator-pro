# README Generator Pro  

## Description
This application is designed to allow the user to generate a professional README after responding to various prompts. The file will contain all of the major sections of a typical README and allow the user to look extremely professional with only a few keystrokes. 

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation) 
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions) 

## Installation 
After cloning the repository into your desired local destination, be sure to run "npm init" as well as "npm i inqurier@8.2.4".

## Usage
After completing the installation instructions, the user will enter "node index" into their terminal. The user will then respond to a series of prompts to dynamically create the following sections of the README: Title, Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, Credits and Questions. The Questions section will include prompted answers with email and github profile. The License section will be added if the user selects any license list choice except for "None of the Above/None". The table of contents is then updated to add this section and the applicable badge displays at the top of the README.
